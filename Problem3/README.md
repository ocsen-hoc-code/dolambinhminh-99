#Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-patterns

1. getPriority Function:
+ The blockchain parameter should explicitly be typed as a string.

2. Undefined Variable:
+ lhsPriority is not defined. It should use balancePriority within useMemo.

3. Combine Conditions:
+ The filter conditions for priority > -99 and amount > 0 can be combined for efficiency.

4. Calculate usdValue:
+ `usdValue` should be calculated within the `formattedBalances` mapping

5. Unused formattedBalances:
+ `formattedBalances` should be used in the component logic instead of being defined but not utilized.


#Improvements Explained

1. Correct Use of useMemo:
+ Combined filtering, sorting, and mapping into one useMemo hook to ensure these computations only happen when balances or prices change.
+ Defined the blockchain property on the WalletBalance interface for type safety.

2. Type Safety:
+ Specified blockchain as a string type in the getPriority function.

3. Single Iteration for Mapping:
+ Merged the mapping of sortedBalances into formattedBalances, which avoids the need for a second mapping pass.

4. Efficient USD Value Calculation:
+ Calculated usdValue during the same pass as formatting.

5. Stable Keys:
+ Used currency and index as the key for WalletRow, assuming it is unique, which is more stable than using the index.

6. Organize the code into directories for improved management:
+ Create a directory for components, including WalletPage and WalletRow.
+ Set up a separate directory for interfaces.
